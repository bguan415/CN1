// On the right is a the timer section. This displays the current amount of time passed; tapping it starts/stops the timer.
//    (Only show two most relevant times here? Minutes/seconds, hours/minutes, days/hours?) (Change color for start/stop?)
// The middle section contains the name label. Tapping it opens the timer box (Accordion funtion? See CN1) showing the description.
// From the "opened" view, the user can tap the name or description to edit them. The full time passed could also be shown on the right?
// An X button also appears by the name when a timer is opened, which allows the user to delete.

// At the bottom of the timer scroll screen, there are two buttons. New Timer adds a timer, Statistics opens the Statistics Screen

// Statistics Screen 
// Four buttons to show stats by size? A search bar to find a specific timer? A log? Settings?
